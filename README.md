# IoB - Insulin on Board

A small Progressive Web App which allows entry of insulin doses and calculates how much is left "on board", using an adapted version of the decay formula at https://github.com/openaps/oref0/blob/dev/lib/iob/calculate.js.

Currently there is only one option of an insulin profile - Fiasp, as that's what I use and therefore what I need - but this could be made configurable in the future.
